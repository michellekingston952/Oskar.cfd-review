Some victims reported that after requesting withdrawals, their accounts were mysteriously suspended.</p>

    <p>Oskar.cfd is not a legitimate broker, and traders should avoid it at all costs. Many beginners fall into its trap, believing they can make easy profits. Unfortunately, once funds are deposited, they are gone forever.</p>
